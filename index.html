<code>Futsal is played with a <div class="firstfutsal"><font color="#e06c75">ball that bounces less than a usual football.</font><span class="fftt"><img style="border-radius:7px; width: 250px; height: auto;"src="./imgs/futsal ball.png"></img></span></div> The game matches are conducted by two referees, each one on the touchlines. There are no </code>
<code>offsides and when a ball reaches out of play, the game is resumes with a kick-in. The game is played with two teams of five, each one of whom is a goalkeeper</code>
<code>Unlimited substitutions are permitted in the game. The game is played indoors with a hard court surface marked by lines; walls or boards are not used.</code>
<code>The surface, ball and rules together favour ball control and passing in small spaces. The game's emphasis is on improvisation, creativity and technique.</code>
<code></code>
<code>The positions of Futsal include the following:</code>
<code> • <div class="firstfutsal"><font color="A0CEA0">The Goalkeeper</font><span class="fftt"><<img style="border-radius:7px; width: 250px; height: auto;"src="./imgs/goalkeeper.jpg"></img></span><span class="ffll">The Goalkeeper is the most specialised position in futsal. A goalkeeper's job is mainly defensive: to guard the team's goal from being breached (to not let the other team score). Goalkeeper is the only position defined in the Laws of the Game. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with their hands and arms, however they are restricted to doing so only within their penalty area; for this reason, they must wear jerseys that distinguish them from other outfield players and the referee.</span></div></code>    
<code> • <div class="firstfutsal"><font color="A0CEA0">The Winger (2)</font><span class="fftt"><img style="border-radius:7px; width: 250px; height: auto;"src="./imgs/winger.jpg"></img></span><span class="ffll">The Winger or Wing or Ala or Flank is a player constantly moving forward and backward in the sides of the pitch (left-wing and right-wing), between defense and attack. This position is not as offensive as the pivot, yet not as defensive as the defender.</span></div></code>   
<code> • <div class="firstfutsal"><font color="A0CEA0">The Pivot</font><span class="fftt"><img style="border-radius:7px; width: 250px; height: auto;"src="./imgs/pivot.kpg"></img></span><span class="ffll">The pivot, also known as the forward or the topman, is the most advanced player on the pitch.</span></div></code>   
<code> • <div class="firstfutsal"<font color="A0CEA0">The Defender</font><span class="fftt"><img style="border-radius:7px; width: 250px; height: auto;"src="./imgs/defender.jpg"></img></span><span class="ffll">This is the list of futsal positions, with a brief explanation of what the position is and notable futsal players of that position.

<code>When it comes to advertising the said sport, we have alot of options, starting with traditional advertisements such as papers, posters, telling other people, boards</code>
<code>and so on. But we can use technology and advertize on social media such as TikTok, Twitter, Facebook, etc. Due to the current generations more people are based </code>
<code>around the internet making advertising easier and much more efficient than we are to do it physically. With this we can show people the sport and teach them about</code>
