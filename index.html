<code>small sided soccer game that is played across the world and is officialy recognized by both the <font color="#d19a66"><i>FIFA</i></font> and <font color="#d19a66"><i>EUFA</i></font>. The word futsal comes from two spanish words which are </code>

<code>Futsal is played with a ball that bounces less than a usual football. The game matches are conducted by two referees, each one on the touchlines. There are no </code>
<code>offsides and when a ball reaches out of play, the game is resumes with a kick-in. The game is played with two teams of five, each one of whom is a goalkeeper</code>
<code>Unlimited substitutions are permitted in the game. The game is played indoors with a hard court surface marked by lines; walls or boards are not used.</code>
<code>The surface, ball and rules together favour ball control and passing in small spaces. The game's emphasis is on improvisation, creativity and technique.</code>
<code></code>
<code>When it comes to advertising the said sport, we have alot of options, starting with traditional advertisements such as papers, posters, telling other people, boards</code>
<code>and so on. But we can use technology and advertize on social media such as TikTok, Twitter, Facebook, etc. Due to the current generations more people are based around the</code>
<code>internet making advertising easier and much more efficient than we are to do it physically.</code>
